# Short-Scoped, Stabilizing Work (Next Milestones)

These are **contained, concrete steps** that consolidate what already exists, without committing to implementation or UI decisions.

- **Freeze v0.1 of the system meta-model**
  - Concept-node schema
  - Concept-family & axes schema
  - Concept acquisition model & motifs
  - Feedback-space spec
  - Subsystems overview

- **Normalize naming and boundaries**
  - Make terminology consistent across all specs
  - Explicitly mark what is *normative* (the model) vs *illustrative* (examples, book content)

- **Formalize the book ↔ system contract (spec-only)**
  - What a book provides as input (chapters, prose, examples, exercises)
  - What the system derives (concept nodes, relationships, exercise templates, signals)

- **Stabilize one complete concept node as a reference**
  - Use *Higher-Order Functions* as the canonical example
  - Treat it as a “golden path” for future concept nodes

- **Document the experimental method used so far**
  - Simulated learner attempts
  - AI-mediated feedback and interpretation
  - Errors, misapplications, timing, and hesitation as first-class signals

> This phase is about **closing loops**, not opening new ones.
