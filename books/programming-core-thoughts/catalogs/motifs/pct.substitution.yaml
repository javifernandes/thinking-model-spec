  name: Substitution (Surface Refactor)
  gesture: "I’ll swap the surface form; the meaning stays the same."

  description: >
    The learner replaces one syntactic construct with another (e.g. `for` → `map`) while keeping
    a procedural framing and not perceiving the intended intent/axis shift. This can look like progress
    but may bypass the conceptual move.

  appears_in:
    - domain: programming
      example: Replacing loops with `map` while still thinking in step-by-step mechanics

  failure_modes:
    - description: Concept bypass (exercise “solved” without acquiring the intended abstraction)

  detection_signals:
    - pattern: mechanical rewrite without change in intent language
      context: code
    - pattern: learner describes `map` as “just a loop with a function inside”
      context: dialogue

  pedagogical_stance: >
    Acknowledge the refactor, then redirect attention to what varies vs what stays stable,
    and surface the intended axis (delegation / semantic-weight) rather than mechanics.
