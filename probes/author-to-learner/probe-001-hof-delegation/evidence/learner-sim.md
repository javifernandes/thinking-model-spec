# Learner Simulation

<!-- moved to evidence/ to match the probe layer structure -->

This file documents simulated learner behavior while engaging with the generated learning experience.

## Learner Profile (Assumed)
- Intermediate programmer
- Familiar with loops and functions
- New to functional abstractions

---

## Learner Interaction 1 — Pattern Recognition

Learner notices repetition in multiple loops but frames it as:
> “This is annoying to rewrite.”

No abstraction is named yet.

**Interpretation**
- Pattern detection without conceptualization
- Cognitive readiness forming

---

## Learner Interaction 2 — Procedural Anchoring

Learner response:
> “So `map` is just a loop with a function inside.”

**Interpretation**
- Correct but shallow understanding
- Focus remains on mechanics

---

## Learner Interaction 3 — Over-Generalization

Learner attempts to replace all loops with `map`.

**Interpretation**
- Pattern absolutism
- Early abstraction enthusiasm

---

## Learner Interaction 4 — Temporal Misuse

Learner stores transformation functions for unrelated future use.

**Interpretation**
- Confusion about scope and lifetime
- Delegation conflated with state reuse
