# Insights & Consequences

<!-- moved to reflection/ to match the probe layer structure -->

## Validated Assumptions
- Prose can be transformed into structured learning entities
- Learner misconceptions emerge predictably
- Feedback can be framed conceptually (axes, intent)

## Broken Assumptions
- More examples ≠ better understanding
- Similar examples reduce semantic contrast

## Author-Facing Insights
- Add counter-examples where `map` is a bad fit
- Delay metaphors until after pattern recognition
- Explicitly contrast “delegation” vs “automation”

## System-Level Implications
- Axis-aware feedback is more effective than rule correction
- Example generation must control semantic distance
- Author feedback loops are essential, not optional

## Promotion Candidates
- Delegation overreach → formal anti-pattern
- Procedural anchoring → acquisition motif

## Notes
This probe suggests that **example diversity** is a first-class design concern.
