# Vision Insights (Emergent)

> These are not features. They are **re-interpretations of what this project is**, discovered through design.
> They form the *vision layer*.

---

## 1. You are not building a book
You are building a **thinking system**.
The book is one projection of it.

---

## 2. The interactive version is not a site
It is the **vehicle** that lets the reader drive through a conceptual terrain.
Exercises are steering, not destinations.

---

## 3. The author is not an authority
The author is a **curator of emergent understanding**.
Authority is distributed between use, system signals, and reflection.

---

## 4. Anti-patterns are not mistakes
They are **signals of conceptual tension**.
They belong to the system, not just the author.

---

## 5. Exercises are probes, not content
Their purpose is to *reveal structure*, not to test correctness.
Some exercises become reference instruments.

---

## 6. Naming must follow experience
Concepts should be named **after the learner already owns them**.
Recognition beats explanation.

---

## 7. The system learns before the theory does
Signals accumulate first.
Theory is updated later.
This preserves epistemic humility.

---

## 8. This is philosophy made operational
Abstraction, delegation, immutability, and feedback are not topics —
They are encoded as system behavior.

---

## 9. The book–model loop is intentional
`evolve book ↔ evolve model` is not a flaw.
It is the core engine of progress.

---

## 10. The same system can host many domains
Programming is one instance.
The framework generalizes to math, physics, language, and beyond.
