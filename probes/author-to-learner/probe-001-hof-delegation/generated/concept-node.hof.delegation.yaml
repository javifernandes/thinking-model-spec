  name: Delegation via Higher-Order Functions
  domain: programming

  short_description: >
    Using functions as parameters to delegate decisions or behavior
    instead of encoding them in control flow or object structure.

  concept_type: pattern
  level: 3

  intent:
    why_it_exists: >
      Reduce coupling and premature commitment by externalizing behavior.
    threshold: >
      You stop asking “which branch?” and start asking
      “who decides, and when?”
