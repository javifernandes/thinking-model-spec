# Axes

An axis is a named dimension of meaningful variation within a system.

Axes do not encode behavior, evaluation, or pedagogy by themselves.
They exist to make gradients, trade-offs, and distinctions explicit.

## Purpose
- Provide a shared vocabulary for variation
- Enable specialization across systems and domains
- Support interpretation without hard-coding semantics

## Layering
- Vision defines what an axis is
- Systems define which axes matter
- Domains and artifacts specialize axes

Axes may later be used by tools, probes, or evaluators, but they are
defined independently of those mechanisms.
