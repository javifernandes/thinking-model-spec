# Feedback Space Specification

> **Subsystem:** Feedback Space
> **Nature:** Emergent, append-only, author-facing

---

## Purpose

Capture *what the system learns before the author does*.

The feedback space records signals generated by real interaction, not by anticipation.

---

## Core Data Types (Conceptual)

* **Signal**

  * type: antipattern | confusion | insight | shortcut | misnaming
  * confidence
  * frequency
  * first_seen / last_seen

* **Evidence**

  * concrete user action
  * code snippet
  * dialogue turn

* **Aggregation**

  * clusters similar signals
  * ranks by impact

---

## Signal Sources

* Exercise attempts
* Dialogue corrections
* Navigation loops
* Aborted interactions

---

## Author Actions

For each signal:

* Promote to concept model
* Promote to book content
* Promote to exercise archetype
* Ignore / archive

---

## Non-Goals

* Automatic content mutation
* Authority over author intent

---

## Design Principle

> The system *listens loudly* but *acts softly*.
