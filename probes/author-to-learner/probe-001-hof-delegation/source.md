# Source Material

**Book:** Programming Core Thoughts  
**Chapter:** Higher-Order Functions  
**Section:** Delegation  
**Pages:** ~63–64

## Summary of the Excerpt

The text introduces Higher-Order Functions through the idea of delegation:
- Repetitive loops performing similar transformations
- Identification of boilerplate vs variable logic
- Extraction of transformation logic into a function
- Delegation of iteration and control to `map`

A managerial metaphor is used:
> A manager delegates repetitive work while retaining responsibility for intent.

The reader is shown:
- before/after code examples
- progressive refactoring
- a conceptual leap from “doing work” to “describing work”

## Authorial Intent (Implicit)
- Shift reader from procedural thinking to declarative thinking
- Normalize passing behavior as data
- Reduce fear of abstraction

This intent is not explicitly encoded, but inferred during the probe.
