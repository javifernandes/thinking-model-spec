# Signals Detected

## Signal A — Substitution Without Abstraction
Learner substitutes syntax (`for` → `map`) without shifting intent framing.

**Acquisition Motif**
Substitution / surface-level refactor

---

## Signal B — Delegation Overreach
Learner applies delegation universally, ignoring cases where control matters.

**Anti-Pattern**
Abstraction absolutism

---

## Signal C — Temporal Axis Confusion
Learner extends lifetime of delegated behavior incorrectly.

**Axis Involved**
Temporal responsibility

---

## Meta-Signal
Most errors arise from **over-application**, not misunderstanding.

This suggests readiness for contrast, not repetition.
