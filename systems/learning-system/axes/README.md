# Learning System Axes

These axes specialize vision-level axes for the learning system.

They describe dimensions along which learning experiences,
content, and interactions may vary.

Axes do not define behavior or implementation.
They exist to support:
- comparison
- interpretation
- probe analysis
- future system design decisions
