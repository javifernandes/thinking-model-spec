description: >
  Learners tend to preserve control flow in the caller
  when first encountering higher-order functions,
  replacing abstraction with conditional branching.

related_concepts:
  - concept.higher-order-function
  - concept.strategy

related_capability_gaps:
  - capability-gap.learner-orientation.behavior-location

implications:
  - Learner-facing material should make the *movement of behavior*
    explicit, not just the syntax.
  - Feedback should name the pattern: "you kept the decision instead
    of delegating it".

confidence: high
