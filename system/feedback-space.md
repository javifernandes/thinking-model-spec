# Feedback Space (Meta-System Sketch)

> **Layer:** System / Learning Loop
>
> The Feedback Space is an append-only knowledge layer where *emergent understanding* is recorded.
> It does not define truth; it captures signals.

## Purpose

* Capture what the author did not (and could not) foresee
* Allow the system to *learn how people learn*
* Create a reflective loop between use and theory

---

## What Enters the Feedback Space

### 1. Emergent Anti-Patterns

* Repeated learner mistakes
* Structurally similar wrong approaches
* Confusions that cut across domains

### 2. Unexpected Concept Links

* Learners jump concepts earlier than planned
* Concepts used together before formal introduction

### 3. Recognition Events

* "You just did X" moments
* Implicit mastery before naming

### 4. Language Signals

* Phrases learners invent
* Metaphors that resonate
* Explanations that reduce friction

### 5. Tutor Performance Signals

* Explanations that lead to rapid correction
* Hints that fail repeatedly

## Structure of a Feedback Event

Each event records:

* `timestamp`
* `concepts_involved`
* `event_type` (antipattern, recognition, confusion, leap)
* `signal`
* `context` (exercise, dialogue, free exploration)
* `source` (learner, AI tutor, aggregate)

---

## Properties

* Append-only (no deletion)
* Non-authoritative
* Reviewable by humans
* Filterable by confidence and frequency

---

## Author Interaction Loop

1. Review accumulated signals
2. Promote selected items into:

   * concept schema updates
   * book revisions
   * new exercise archetypes
3. Regenerate derived artifacts

---

## Design Principle

> The system learns *before* the theory does.
> The author decides *after*.
