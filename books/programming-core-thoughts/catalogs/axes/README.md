# Axes (Programming Core Thoughts)

This directory contains **domain/book-specific axes** used to describe concept families and learning signals in
*Programming Core Thoughts*.

## Relationship to system meta-axes

Some book axes are specializations or re-framings of system-level meta-axes.
When that’s the case, an axis should declare `maps_to: <meta-axis>` (see [`thinking-model-spec/system/catalogs/meta-axes.md`](../../../system/catalogs/meta-axes.md)).
