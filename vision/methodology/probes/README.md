# Probe Instances

This directory contains **probe instances** described as YAML manifests.

## Why this exists

- [`../probes.md`](../probes.md) defines what probes are (concept + methodology).
- Probe instances are concrete runs (or designs for runs) that should be reviewable,
  comparable, and promotable.

## Schema

- [`../probe.schema.yaml`](../probe.schema.yaml) defines the probe manifest structure.

## Instances

- `instances/` contains the current probe manifests.
