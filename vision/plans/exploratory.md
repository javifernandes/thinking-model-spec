### 5.2 Exploratory but Contained Work

Low‑risk explorations that inform future design.

* Walk multiple learner attempts through one concept node
* Manually simulate feedback detection
* Identify what *cannot* be specified upfront
* Draft example author workflows (review → promote → regenerate)

Outcome: confidence in the feedback loop model.

### 5.3 Tooling‑Adjacent Design (No Code Yet)

Conceptual design only.

* Spec a **book‑to‑model mapper** (PDF/LaTeX → concept graph)
* Spec regeneration contracts (what changes invalidate what)
* Sketch author dashboards (signals, stats, decisions)

Outcome: tooling becomes spec‑driven, not ad‑hoc.
