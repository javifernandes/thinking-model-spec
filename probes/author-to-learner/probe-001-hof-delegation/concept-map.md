# Concept Map (Derived)

## Primary Concept Node
**Higher-Order Function (HOF)**  
A function that delegates part of its behavior by receiving another function.

## Sub-Concept
**Delegation**
Responsibility for *how* work happens is transferred, while intent remains with the caller.

## Related Concept Family
**Control Abstractions / Delegation**

Members include:
- map
- filter
- reduce
- callbacks
- strategy objects (OO)

## Activated Axes of Variation

### Semantic Axis
Procedural (“how”) → Declarative (“what”)

### Responsibility Axis
Caller owns loop → Function owns loop

### Temporal Axis
Repeated local logic → Reusable abstraction

## Observations
- The chapter implicitly activates these axes without naming them.
- Learner confusion tends to cluster around axis boundaries.
