  description: >
    The learner encodes variation via control flow (if/else, switch) rather than reifying behavior
    as a value. This is often a transitional move (near-miss) and can indicate readiness for delegation.

  appears_in:
    - domain: programming
      example: Selecting behavior by `player_type` branches inside a stable engine

  failure_modes:
    - description: Case explosion and tight coupling between engine and variations

  detection_signals:
    - pattern: if/else on mode or type to select behavior
      context: code
    - pattern: learner justifies branching as “clearer what each player does”
      context: dialogue

  pedagogical_stance: >
    Treat as a productive near-miss: identify the stable engine vs variable behavior,
    then offer delegation-as-value as a way to keep clarity without encoding choices in branches.
