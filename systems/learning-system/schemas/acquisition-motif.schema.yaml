# Acquisition Motif Schema (v0.1)
#
# IMPORTANT DISTINCTION
# - This schema describes a *motif definition* (M1, M2, ...) as a stable catalog item.
# - A runtime system would emit *events* when a motif is detected; those are modeled via
#   the feedback-event schema (and may include references to motif ids).
